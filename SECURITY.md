# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This package has no LTS releases - this means that we will only support the latest minor release with feature updates.
Because we never had any security vulnearbilities until now we don't promise any list of versions.
Instead we will decide this from case to case - depending on factors like:
* vulnerable versions
* age of the versions
* usage of the versions (packagist downloads)
* effort needed to fix it in the versions

At all we will do our best to fix security issues and inform all users about possible issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Because security vulnerabilities could harm users we please you to don't use the public issue tracker to report them.
Please write a mail to [dev.gummibeer@gmail.com](mailto:dev.gummibeer@gmail.com).
Depending on the kind of issue we will create a public issue/security alert or fix it and inform afterwards.
